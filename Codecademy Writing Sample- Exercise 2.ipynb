    "a) I chose to create a distinct exercise about how to merge a list of lists into a flat list using a nested loop. This task felt relevant to me because I found myself doing this when working through Codecademy challenge exercises. This task fits into the learning objective for these four exercises: how to take a list and generate a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) My style diverges from Codecademy in that I teach creating a flat list as a distinct exercise, while Codecademy teaches more generally how to use a nested loop. This exercise is supposed to teach a specific application of nested loops to a learner who already has a background with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "One pattern I have observed in Codecademy exercises is that there is generally one starting code per exercise and all parts of the exercise work off that starting code. I originally considered combining my Exercises 1 and 2, which would have involved two starting blocks of code (numbers in Exercise 1 and list_of_lists in Exercise 2). I ultimately decided that it would be too overwhelming for a learner to deal with two disconnected starting codes. The instructions would be longer and I would have to include more examples in one exercise. I therefore chose to stick with Codecademy's style of having two shorter exercises, each with its own starting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) I would want feedback on whether I should be more explicit about what a flat list is and why it can be useful to create one. Is the exercise too easy because it is very close to the given example?\n"
